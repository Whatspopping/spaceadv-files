                    <h1> THE SOLAR SYSTEM</h1>
                       The Solar System was formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud.
                       Over time, the cloud formed the Sun and a protoplanetary disk that gradually coalesced to form planets and other objects.
                       That is the reason why all eight planets have an orbit that lies near the same plane. In the present day, 99.86% of the
                       Solar System's mass is in the Sun and most of the remaining mass is contained in the planet Jupiter. Six planets, the 
                       six largest possible dwarf planets and many other bodies have natural satellites or moons orbiting around them. All giant
                       planets and a few smaller bodies are encircled by planetary rings, composed of ice, dust and sometimes moonlets.<br>
    
                      There are an unknown number of smaller dwarf planets and innumerable small bodies orbiting the Sun. These objects are
                      distributed in the asteroid belt that lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, the Kuiper belt, the scattered disc
                      that both lies beyond Neptune's orbit and at even further reaches of the Solar System which they would be classified as
                      an extreme trans-Neptunian object. There is consensus among astronomers to these nine objects as dwarf planets: the asteroid Ceres,
                      the Kuiper-belt objects Pluto, Orcus, Haumea, Quaoar, and Makemake, and the scattered-disc objects Gonggong, Eris, and Sedna.
                      any small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between the regions of 
                      the Solar System.<br>
                      The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region known as the heliosphere.
                       The heliopause is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; 
                       it extends out to the edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets,
                        may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. Beyond these is the end of the Solar System. 
                        The Solar System belongs to the Milky Way, and the closest star to the Solar System (except for the Sun) is named Proxima Centauri
                         at a distance of 4.2441 light-years away.<br>

                    The Sun is the Solar System's star and by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses), which comprises 99.86% 
                    of all the mass in the Solar System, produces temperatures and densities in its core high enough to sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium.
                     This releases an enormous amount of energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking in visible light.

                    Because the Sun fuses hydrogen into helium at its core, it is a main-sequence star. More specifically, it is a G2-type main-sequence star, 
                    where the type designation refers to its effective temperature. Hotter main-sequence stars are more luminous. The Sun's temperature is intermediate
                     between that of the hottest stars and that of the coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and 
                     cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up about 75% of the stars in the Milky Way.

                    The four terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars
                    The four terrestrial or inner planets have dense, rocky compositions, few or no moons, and no ring systems. 
                    They are composed largely of refractory minerals such as the silicates—which form their crusts and mantles—and metals 
                    such as iron and nickel which form their cores. Three of the four inner planets (Venus, Earth and Mars) have atmospheres
                     substantial enough to generate weather; all have impact craters and tectonic surface features, such as rift valleys and 
                     volcanoes. The term inner planet should not be confused with inferior planet, which designates those planets that are 
                     closer to the Sun than Earth is (i.e. Mercury and Venus).

                    <p>Main article: Mercury image</p>
                    Mercury (45.9–88.0 million km; 28.5–54.7 million mi) from the Sun is the closest planet to the Sun. The smallest planet
                     in the Solar System. Mercury has no natural satellites. The dominant geological features are impact craters or basins 
                     with ejecta blankets, the remains of early volcanic activity including magma flows, and lobed ridges or rupes that were
                      probably produced by a period of contraction early in the planet's history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists
                       of solar-wind particles trapped by Mercury's magnetic field, as well as atoms blasted off its surface by the solar
                        wind. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that
                         its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact, or that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young
                          Sun's energy. There  have been searches for "Vulcanoids", asteroids in stable orbits between Mercury and the Sun,
                           but none have been discovered.

                    Venus  (107.4–108.9 million km; 66.7–67.7 million mi) from the Sun is close in size to Earth  and, like Earth, has a 
                    thick silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. 
                    It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the
                     hottest planet, with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F), mainly due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the 
                     atmosphere. The planet has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which 
                     suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions. A relatively young planetary surface
                      displays extensive evidence of volcanic activity, but is devoid of plate tectonics. It may undergo resurfacing 
                      episodes on a time scale of 700 million years.

                    Earth  (147.1–152.1 million km; 91.4–94.5 million mi) from the Sun is the largest and densest of the inner planets,
                     the only one known to have current geological activity, and the only place in the universe where life is known to 
                     exist. Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets, and it is the only planet where plate
                      tectonics has been observed. Earth's atmosphere is radically different from those of the other planets, having been 
                      altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. The planetary magnetosphere shields the surface from 
                      solar and cosmic radiation, limiting atmospheric stripping and maintaining habitability. It has one natural 
                      satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet in the Solar System.

                    Mars (206.7–249.2 million km; 128.5–154.9 million mi) from the Sun) is smaller than Earth and Venus. It has an
                     atmosphere of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (0.088 psi; 0.18 inHg); roughly 0.6%
                      of that of Earth but sufficient to support weather phenomena. Its surface, peppered with volcanoes, such as Olympus
                       Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as
                        recently as 2 million years ago. Its red color comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil. Mars has two tiny natural
                         satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be either captured asteroids,[108] or ejected debris from a massive

                    Jupiter (740.7–816.4 million km; 460.2–507.3 million mi) from the Sun[89]), at 318 MEarth, is 2.5 times the mass of
                     all the other planets put together. It is composed largely of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter's strong internal heat 
                     creates semi-permanent features in its atmosphere, such as cloud bands and the Great Red Spot. The planet possesses 
                     a 4.2–14 Gauss strength magnetosphere that spans 22–29 million km, making it, in certain respects, the largest object
                      in the Solar System.[130] Jupiter has 95 known satellites. The four largest, Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa, are

                     has several similarities to Jupiter, such as its atmospheric composition and magnetosphere. Although Saturn has 60% 
                     of Jupiter's volume, it is less than a third as massive, at 95 MEarth. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar 
                      that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn are made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 145
                       confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of these, Titan and Enceladus, show signs of geological activity;
                        they, as well as five other Saturnian moons (Iapetus, Rhea, Dione, Tethys, and Mimas), are large enough to be

                    Uranus (2.733–3.001 billion km; 1.698–1.865 billion mi) from the Sun, at 14 MEarth, has the lowest mass of the outer
                     planets. Uniquely among the planets, it orbits the Sun on its side; its axial tilt is over ninety degrees to the 
                     ecliptic. This gives the planet extreme seasonal variation as each pole points toward and then away from the Sun. 
                     It has a much colder core than the other giant planets and radiates very little heat into space. As a consequence,
                      it has the coldest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System. Uranus has 27 known satellites, the largest ones being 
                      Titania, Oberon, Umbriel, Ariel, and Miranda. Like the other giant planets, it possesses a ring system and

                    Neptune (4.471–4.558 billion km; 2.778–2.832 billion mi) from the Sun), though slightly smaller than Uranus, is more
                     massive (17 MEarth) and hence more dense. It radiates more internal heat than Uranus, but not as much as Jupiter or 
                     Saturn. Neptune has 14 known satellites. The largest, Triton, is geologically active, with geysers of liquid nitrogen.
                      Triton is the only large satellite with a retrograde orbit, which indicates that it did not form with Neptune, but 
                      was probably captured from the Kuiper belt. Neptune is accompanied in its orbit by several minor planets, termed 
                      Neptune trojans, that either lead or trail the planet by about one-sixth of the way around the Sun, positions known 
                      as Lagrange points.

                     Uranus usually appears in classroom solar system models as a featureless blue ball, but this gas giant of the outer solar system is pretty weird on closer inspection. First, the planet rotates
                     on its side, appearing to roll around the sun like a ball, according to The most likely 
                     explanation for the planet's unusual orientation (about 90 degrees sideways compared to the other planets) is that it underwent some sort of titanic collision in the ancient past. <br>
                     Uranus' tilt causes what NASA considers to be the most extreme seasons in the solar system. For about a quarter of each Uranus year (or 21 Earth years, as each Uranus year is 84 years long), 
                     the sun shines directly over the north or south pole of the planet. That means for more than two decades on Earth, half of Uranus never sees the sun at all. <br>

                    While Mars seems quiet now, gigantic volcanoes once dominated the surface of the planet Olympus Mons, the biggest volcano ever discovered in the solar system. At 374 miles (602 km) across,
                    the volcano is comparable to the size of Arizona. It's 16 miles (25 kilometers) high, or triple the height of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth. By volume, according to NASA,
                    Olympus Mons 100 times larger than Earth's largest volcano, Hawaii's Mauna Loa.<br>
                    Scientists speculate that volcanoes on Mars can grow to such immense size because gravity there is much weaker than it is on Earth.

                    NASA has been exploring space for more than 60 years, and have been lucky enough to get close-up pictures of dozens of celestial objects. Most notably, we've sent spacecraft to all of 
                    the planets in our solar system — Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune — as well as two dwarf planets, Pluto and Ceres.

                    Mercury is already the smallest planet in the solar system (excluding the dwarf planet Pluto, of course), and the second-densest after Earth. And it's only 
                    getting smaller and denser.<br>
                    For many years, scientists believed that Earth was the only tectonically active planet in the solar system. That changed after the Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging (messenger) 
                    spacecraft did the first orbital mission at Mercury, mapping the entire planet in high definition and getting a look at the 
                    features on its surface.<br>
                    In 2016, data from MESSENGER revealed cliff-like landforms known as fault scarps. Because the fault scarps are relatively small,
                    scientists are sure that they weren't created that long ago and that the planet is still contracting 4.5 billion years after the solar system was formed.

                    Along with being the solar system's largest planet, Jupiter also hosts the solar system's largest storm. Known as the Great Red Spot,
                     it's been observed in telescopes since the 1600s and studied from modern instruments like NASA's Juno, which recently provided evidence that the storm is hundreds of miles tall (and likely fed by winds 
                     from thousands of miles below, too). The storm has been a raging conundrum for centuries, but in recent decades another mystery emerged: the spot is getting smaller.

                    In January 2015, California Institute of Technology astronomers Konstantin Batygin and Mike Brown announced — based on mathematical calculations and simulations — that there could be a giant planet
                    lurking far beyond Neptune. Several teams are now on the search for this theoretical "HYP Planet Nine," and research
                    suggests it could be located within the decade. <br>
                    This large object, if it exists, could help explain the movements of some objects in the Kuiper Belt, an icy collection of objects beyond Neptune's orbit.
                    Brown has already discovered several large objects in that area that in some cases rivaled or exceeded the size of Pluto. (His discoveries were one of the catalysts for changing Pluto's status from planet to dwarf planet in 2006.)

                    Neptune is roughly 30 times as far from the sun as Earth, and it gets correspondingly less heat and light. But it radiates far more heat than it's taking in and has far more activity in its
                    atmosphere than planetary scientists would suspect, especially compared to nearby Uranus. Uranus is closer to the sun and yet radiates about the same amount of heat as Neptune, and scientists aren't sure why. <br>
                    Winds on Neptune can blow up to 1,500 miles per hour (2,400 km/h). Is all that energy coming from the sun, from the planet's core, or gravitational contraction? Researchers are working to find out.

                    Asteroids is a minor planet, an object that is neither a true planet nor a comet, that orbits within the inner solar 
                    system. They are rocky,mettalic or icy bodies with no atmosphere. Sizes and shapes of asteroids vary significantly, 
                    ranging from 1meter rocks to a dwarf planet almost 1000 km in diameter.

                    A comet is an icy small solar system body that warms and begins to release gases when passing close to the sun, 
                    a process called outgassing. This produces an extended, gravitationally unbound atmosphere or coma surrounding the 
                    nucleus, and sometimes a tail of gas and dust blown out from the coma. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar
                     radiation and the out streaming solar wind plasma acting upon the nucleus of the comets. The coma maybe up to 15times
                      Earths diameter, while the tail may stretch beyond one astronomical unit. If sufficiently close and bright, a comet
                       may be seen from the earth without the aid of a telescope and can subtend an arc of up to 300 (60 Moons) across 
                       the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures and religions.
